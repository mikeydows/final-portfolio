            <p>
                I’m a multidisciplinary digital creative with a strong foundation in web development, graphic design, video editing, and UI/UX design, bringing together both artistic vision and technical expertise to build engaging and impactful digital experiences. My work sits at the intersection of creativity and functionality, where design meets strategy, and where visual storytelling is aligned with seamless user experience.
                <br><br><br>
                As a web developer, I specialize in building responsive, high-performance websites that are not only visually appealing but also optimized for speed, accessibility, and user engagement. I work with modern technologies and frameworks to create dynamic, scalable web solutions that align with business goals and brand identity.
                <br><br><br>
                In the realm of graphic design, I bring concepts to life through strong visual narratives, whether it's branding, marketing collateral, or social media content. I have a keen eye for aesthetics, color theory, and typography, allowing me to create visuals that captivate and communicate effectively.
                <br><br><br>
                As a UI/UX designer, I focus on designing intuitive user journeys. I apply user research, wireframing, prototyping, and testing to ensure that every product I design is not only beautiful but also user-centric and accessible. My process always starts with understanding the user—what they need, how they think, and how they interact with digital products.
                <br><br><br>
                Additionally, I have hands-on experience in video editing, creating visually rich and emotionally resonant multimedia content. From promotional videos to social media reels, I use motion graphics and post-production techniques to craft engaging narratives that elevate brand presence and audience connection
